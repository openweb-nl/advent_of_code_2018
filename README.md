# advent_of_code_2018

## What is advent of code?

Advent of code is an annual event in December when each day a new coding 
challenge is posted on [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2018).
It will start the first of December.
There is a competition be sending the solution. We can use '286802-3ab759fc' for our own leaderboard.
It's nice to put the code used to get the answers in a fork of this repo, so we can easily share/compare solutions.

## Languages

The challanges are made so that any language can be used. I would say a small readme for RCH
each solution on how to run it would be nice. A run script and/or a dockerfile would do.
